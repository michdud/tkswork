# TKS Work
Odds and ends from my work at The Knox Student.

# Word Scrambler
Takes a list of tab-separated words from user input or a file and outputs the scrambled words and blanks for readers to fill in.

# Map
A simple map frame used in the article ["Students return from term abroad."](http://www.theknoxstudent.com/news/2018/01/18/students-return-term-abroad/#.Xa9i9JMzbzI)
